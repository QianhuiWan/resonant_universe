# Resonant Universe
Exploring the emergence of matter, time, and consciousness from string theory and wave-based dynamics.

# The Resonant Universe: From Strings to Consciousness

This project explores the possibility that reality is fundamentally wave-based, as suggested by string theory, and that consciousness and free will may emerge as stable resonant structures within this vibrational framework.

## ðŸ”­ What this project explores:
- Can everything, including matter and mind, emerge from vibration alone?
- Is free will a natural consequence of wave-based systems?
- What is consciousness in a universe made of strings?
- How do ancient philosophies align with modern physical theories?

## ðŸ§© Topics Covered
- String theory & vibrational ontology
- Wave-based models of reality
- Quantum mind & consciousness
- Free will in indeterministic systems
- Philosophical parallels (Buddhism, Taoism, Vedanta)

## ðŸ“š Coming soon:
- Diagrams and intuitive explanations
- A blog-style write-up of "10 Hypotheses of Reality"
- Sci-fi short stories based on the model
